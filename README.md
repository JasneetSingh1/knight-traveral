## Description

This project implements a shortest-path solver for a knight on a chessboard. Given a starting position and a target position, the program calculates the optimal sequence of moves using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The goal is to practice and reinforce understanding of graphs, BFS traversal, and path tracking.

## Features

- Computes the shortest path for a knight on an 8x8 chessboard.
- Uses BFS to ensure the optimal solution is found.
- Keeps track of visited positions to prevent redundant calculations.
- Returns the sequence of moves taken from start to destination.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Project Challenges

- **Understanding BFS Traversal**: Initially, the implementation did not correctly track the path, leading to incorrect move sequences. The issue was resolved by maintaining a queue of paths instead of just moves.
- **Tracking the Path**: The main challenge was ensuring that each move retained its history so that the final sequence could be reconstructed.


## Thoughts and Observations

- BFS is the ideal algorithm for this type of shortest-path problem, as it guarantees the minimal number of moves.
- Initially, a heuristic sorting approach was used, but it was unnecessary since BFS naturally finds the shortest path.
- Debugging involved manually printing paths at each step to verify the movement logic.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a graphical representation of the knightâ€™s movement on a chessboard.
- Expand the algorithm to support different board sizes.
- Optimize performance by reducing redundant computations.
